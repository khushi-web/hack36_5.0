Until now, online shopping has been lonely. It’s brought the benefits of accessing a wide variety of products with the convenience of being shipped to your door -- but it’s stripped out all human connection. With ShopSquad, we’re bringing you all three. Our users can go shopping with their friends and hang out at the same time. You can play games together and use the prizes to get discounts on griop order.
A McKinsey report said more than half of consumers want stores to follow safety guidelines for the sake of both shoppers and workers, and 59% said it’s important that stores aren’t crowded. 

The shift to e-commerce, which began years before the spread of COVID-19, has accelerated in 2020. E-commerce is expected to jump 18% in 2020, up from a previous forecast of 13%, according to a June eMarketer report. Total sales are expected to drop 10.5% to $4.894 billion.

“People tend to have a higher probability to buy when with another person or a group because a friend affirms decisions that one might not make when shopping alone, so the shopper has a reduced risk perception of the purchase which makes the activity more careless,” says Max H. Brüggemann, director of customer engagement at Capgemini Invent.


ShopSquad is a social shopping platform where you can find more than 1,000 vetted brands across women’s and men’s clothing and accessories, makeup, skin care, home decor and more.You can shop together while doing it safely. That’s great during COVID-19 and great after COVID-19.

A few people, alone in their homes, chatting and browsing without looking at each other, can still feel a sense of togetherness, says Kahn. The pandemic has prompted cultural change in how people shop and spend time together: the popularity of live streaming, which has similar benefits like providing trust and transparency that e-commerce has traditionally lacked, has made its way from Asia to other countries globally. Group shopping could be the next shopping habit to make the leap.
Whether it’s holiday shopping with family, getting fashion advice from friends, eliciting apartment decorating help from the design-savvy people in your life, or just hanging out and in need of something to do, go shopping together again with ShopSquad.

The shared shopping experience provides more credibility for a product and word of mouth has always been a strong driver for purchase.

Problems in the present E-commerce:
- There is no convenient platform to enable users to experience shopping with their loved ones.
- A third party is often used to share items and get opinions from friends. 
- Right now users either have more than one accounts, one for personal use and one for sharing. This brings a lot of security issues and redundant work. ShopSquad solves this by allowing them to make groups within the application. 
- There is always a doubt on whether an item will look as good as it looks on the site.  There are only a few website that provide virtual try on facility.
