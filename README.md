Until now, online shopping has been lonely. It’s brought the benefits of accessing a wide variety of products with the convenience of being shipped to your door -- but it’s stripped out all human connection. With CartBuddy, we’re bringing you all three. Our users can go shopping with their friends and hang out at the same time. You can play games together and use the prizes to get discounts on griup order.
Whether it’s holiday shopping with family, getting fashion advice from friends, eliciting apartment decorating help from the design-savvy people in your life, or just hanging out and in need of something to do, go shopping together again with CartBuddy.

At CartBuddy, we want to be there for every moment of your online shopping journey. Whether that’s shopping with friends through Shop Party, finding inspiration for your life in our shoppable content feed, showing off your style choices on your own profile, or searching for and buying a quality product.

Come hang out, sell and shop with your friends on Shop Party, a virtual social shopping event through video chat. You can join the Verishop community and create a profile to share your ideas by uploading photos and videos, tagging products, saving and sharing curated collections, and following your favorite people and brands. Check out with fast, free shipping, free returns, 24/7 customer care and the best price guarantee.

You can shop together while doing it safely. That’s great during COVID-19 and great after COVID-19.


A McKinsey report said more than half of consumers want stores to follow safety guidelines for the sake of both shoppers and workers, and 59% said it’s important that stores aren’t crowded. 

The shift to e-commerce, which began years before the spread of COVID-19, has accelerated in 2020. E-commerce is expected to jump 18% in 2020, up from a previous forecast of 13%, according to a June eMarketer report. Total sales are expected to drop 10.5% to $4.894 billion.
